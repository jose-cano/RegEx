# RegEx
A regular expression (regex) is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern. Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation. It is a technique developed in theoretical computer science and formal language theory. Many programming languages provide regex capabilities either built-in or via libraries, as it has uses in many situations.
